## What?

conductaid is a set of wearable devices that help visually impaired musicians
in orchestras, by translating the motions of the conductor as audible feedback
to the musicians.

## Why?

From Ray Charles to Stevie Wonder, from Ronnie Millsap to Andrea Bocelli, many
musicians let the world enjoy their music, despite their visual impairments.

Despite music is a ubiquitous outlet for visually impaired members of the
society, there are no methods in place to allow visually impaired musicians
to perform in orchestras.

conductaid is aiming to remove the communication barrier between the conductor
and the visually impaired musicians - and is asking your help in doing so.

## How?

Coding and algorithms.
